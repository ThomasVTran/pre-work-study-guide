# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
To further develop my learning experience in the future I have created the website as a reference to the basics of what I will/have learned in the SMU Coding Bootcamp. In the pocess of this program I have learned the very basics of what is possible in Github and what a single person can do on one terminal.
